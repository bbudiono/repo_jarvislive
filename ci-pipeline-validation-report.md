## CI Pipeline Hardening Features

âœ… **Enhanced Build Retry Logic**: Implemented 3-attempt retry mechanism  
âœ… **Comprehensive Artifact Collection**: Build logs and failure diagnostics  
âœ… **Build Failure Analysis**: Automated error analysis and reporting  
âœ… **Pipeline Health Monitoring**: Dedicated health check job  
âœ… **Improved Device Selection**: Updated simulator targets  
âœ… **Dependency Validation**: Enhanced Python dependency checking  

## Recommendations

1. **Monitor Build Performance**: Track build times and success rates
2. **Regular Pipeline Updates**: Keep CI configuration updated with project changes
3. **Dependency Management**: Regularly update and audit dependencies
4. **Documentation**: Keep CI documentation synchronized with implementation

## Next Steps

- âœ… CI pipeline hardening completed
- ðŸ”„ Monitor pipeline performance in production
- ðŸ“Š Collect metrics on build success rates
- ðŸ”§ Fine-tune retry logic and timeout values based on real-world usage
