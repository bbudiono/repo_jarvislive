- **Agent Task:** Fix async/await and actor isolation issues
- **Critical Fixes:**
  - Fixed generic type mismatch in `PythonBackendClient` continuation handling
  - Updated deprecated `SecTrustGetCertificateAtIndex` to `SecTrustCopyCertificateChain`
  - Added missing properties: `@Published var isConnected`, `startVoiceSession()`, `classifyVoiceCommand()`
  - Added missing `ConversationManager` methods: `addVoiceInteraction()`, `addCommandCompletion()`, `addErrorEvent()`
  - Created type conversion extensions between `ClassificationResult` and `UIClassificationResult`
- **Files Modified:** `PythonBackendClient.swift`, `ConversationManager.swift`, pipeline integration files
- **Impact:** Proper Swift concurrency compliance, eliminated actor isolation violations

#### 4. **Pipeline API Signature Alignment** ‚úÖ
- **Agent Task:** Fix VoiceCommandPipeline API mismatches
- **Critical Solutions:**
  - Added missing `$lastError` published property to `MCPServerManagerProtocol`
  - Fixed `executeVoiceCommand` method signature to accept `ClassificationResult` parameter
  - Updated mock implementations for protocol conformance
  - Added `MCPExecutionResult` and `MCPClientError` structures
- **Files Modified:** `VoiceCommandPipeline.swift`, `MCPServerManager.swift`, mock implementations
- **Impact:** Pipeline now properly integrates with MCP server manager through correct protocol interface

#### 5. **Type Visibility & Access Control** ‚úÖ
- **Agent Task:** Fix public/internal type visibility conflicts
- **Solutions Applied:**
  - Made `DocumentPermissions`, `DocumentMetadata`, `DocumentOperation` public in `SharedDocumentManager.swift`
  - Resolved collaboration manager public property access issues
- **Files Modified:** `SharedDocumentManager.swift`, `RealTimeDocumentCollaborationManager.swift`
- **Impact:** Eliminated public/internal type access violations
