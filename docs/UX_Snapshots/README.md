# UX Snapshots - Visual Evidence Directory
**Purpose:** Automated UI screenshot validation for glassmorphism theme compliance
**Generated by:** VisualValidationTests.swift XCUITest suite
**Date:** 2025-06-26

## Screenshot Collection

This directory contains automated screenshots captured during UI testing to provide visual evidence of glassmorphism theme implementation across the Jarvis Live iOS application.

### Required Screenshots

1. **main_content_view_glassmorphism.png** - Primary app interface with glass morphism effects
2. **conversation_history_glassmorphism.png** - Conversation management UI with glass cards
3. **settings_view_glassmorphism.png** - Settings interface with secure input fields
4. **collaboration_view_glassmorphism.png** - Real-time collaboration interface
5. **document_generation_glassmorphism.png** - Document generation workflow UI

### Validation Criteria

Each screenshot validates:
- ✅ Glass morphism blur effects applied
- ✅ Consistent visual design language
- ✅ Proper glass card containers
- ✅ Accessibility compliance
- ✅ UI responsiveness and performance

### Automation

Screenshots are automatically generated via:
```swift
XCUIApplication().screenshot()
```

And saved to both:
- App documents directory for runtime validation
- Project docs/UX_Snapshots/ for version control evidence

### Audit Compliance

These screenshots provide verifiable evidence for:
- **TASK-TEST-002**: iOS UI Snapshot Validation Suite
- **Glassmorphism Theme Consistency**: Visual proof of UI claims
- **Accessibility Validation**: VoiceOver compatibility evidence
- **Performance Testing**: UI responsiveness verification

**Note:** Screenshots are regenerated on each test run to ensure current UI state validation.
