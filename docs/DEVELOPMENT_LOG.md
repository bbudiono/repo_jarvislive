**4. Dependency & Scope Resolution (Errors 7, 10):**
- `RTCDataChannel` scope error â†’ Commented out WebRTC dependencies (b3d56bb)
- `SimpleConversationMessage` scope error â†’ Used `ConversationMessageDTO` (af4ea39)

**5. Type System & Conversion (Error 11):**
- `AES.GCM.Nonce` conversion errors (e9bcd7b)
- Fixed: Proper Data() conversions and AES.GCM.Nonce(data:) handling

**6. Redeclaration Conflicts (Error 12):**
