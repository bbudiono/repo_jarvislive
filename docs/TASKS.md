## ðŸ”„ STANDARD DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW (MANDATORY)

### Development Process (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
1. **Task Assignment**: All work must correspond to a prioritized task in this file
2. **Branch Creation**: Create feature branch from `main` (e.g., `feature/TASK-P1-001-swiftlint-remediation`)
3. **Sandbox-First Development**: All changes developed in `JarvisLive-Sandbox` target first
4. **Test-Driven Development**: Follow TDD principles with comprehensive test coverage
5. **Quality Gates**: All code must pass CI/CD pipeline (SwiftLint, tests, security audits)
6. **Code Review**: Feature branch merged to `main` only after successful CI run
7. **Production Promotion**: Use `promote_sandbox_to_production.sh` only during formal releases

### Release Management Process
1. **Version Preparation**: Use `scripts/prepare_release.sh` for automated versioning
2. **Release Branch**: Create `release/vX.Y.Z` branch for final preparation
3. **CI Validation**: Ensure `validate-production-build` job passes on main branch
4. **Tag Creation**: Create annotated Git tag with comprehensive release notes
5. **Documentation Update**: Update CHANGELOG.md with all changes
