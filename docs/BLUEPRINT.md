## Basic Use Cases & Workflows (MVP)

### Workflow 1: Core Voice Conversation
1. **User:** "Hey Jarvis, what's the capital of Australia?"
2. **System:** Uses `speech-to-text` to process voice via LiveKit pipeline.
3. **AI Processing:** A selected AI provider (Claude/GPT/Gemini) processes the request.
4. **Response Generation:** The AI provider returns a text response.
5. **Voice Synthesis:** ElevenLabs synthesizes the text into a natural voice response.
6. **Playback:** The synthesized audio is played back to the user.

### Workflow 2: Secure Credential Entry
1. **User:** Navigates to the Settings screen to add an API key.
2. **Authentication:** The app prompts for Face ID/Touch ID to unlock credential management.
3. **Input:** User securely inputs their API key into a text field.
4. **Storage:** The app uses the `KeychainManager` to store the key securely in the iOS Keychain.
5. **Confirmation:** The UI confirms that the key has been saved.
