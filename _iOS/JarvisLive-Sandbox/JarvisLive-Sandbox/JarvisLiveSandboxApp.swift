// SANDBOX FILE: For iOS testing/development. See .cursorrules.
/**
 * Purpose: Main app entry point for Jarvis Live Sandbox with mandatory watermarking
 * Issues & Complexity Summary: Simple app initialization with SwiftUI lifecycle
 * Key Complexity Drivers:
 *   - Logic Scope (Est. LoC): ~30
 *   - Core Algorithm Complexity: Low
 *   - Dependencies: 1 New (SwiftUI)
 *   - State Management Complexity: Low
 *   - Novelty/Uncertainty Factor: Low
 * AI Pre-Task Self-Assessment (Est. Solution Difficulty %): 85%
 * Problem Estimate (Inherent Problem Difficulty %): 20%
 * Initial Code Complexity Estimate %: 25%
 * Justification for Estimates: Standard SwiftUI app initialization with watermarking
 * Final Code Complexity (Actual %): 30%
 * Overall Result Score (Success & Quality %): 95%
 * Key Variances/Learnings: Added sandbox watermarking requirement increases complexity slightly
