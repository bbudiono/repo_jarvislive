**MANDATORY COMPLIANCE FOR THIS DOCUMENT**
**P0 STOP EVERYTHING RULE (CRITICAL AND MANDATORY)**
*YOU HAVE A SINGLE PRIMARY DIRECTIVE - TO BUILD A POLISHED, BEAUTIFUL AND COHESIVE APPLICATION THAT IS FIT FOR PURPOSE. SANDBOX IS NOT REQUIRED FOR WEB APPLICATIONS.*
The ONLY code difference permitted between environments is a visible "Sandbox" watermark/tagline in the Sandbox build. New features that get implemented and PASS ALL TESTS IN Sandbox are then pushed to Production.
This rule is enforced project-wide, supersedes any conflicting guidance, and is cross-referenced in all major rule files. Violation is a P0 STOP EVERYTHING event and must be logged and remediated immediately.

**P0 CRITICAL VIOLATION MANDATES (RANKED)**
**NO PRODUCTION CODE EDITING UNLESS SANDBOX HAS PASSED ALL TESTS.** *THIS IS NOT REQUIRED FOR WEB APPLICATIONS.*
**USER MUST EXPLICITLY ACKNOWLEDGE PRODUCTION CODE CHANGES.**
**SCRIPTS MUST BE PROJECT AGNOSTIC, OPERATING ONLY WITHIN THEIR ROOT FOLDER/SUBFOLDER HIERARCHY.**
**TREAT REFACTORING LIKE ANY TASK (SANDBOX‚ÜíPRODUCTION CYCLE). USER MUST EXPLICITLY SAY "I ACCEPT...üëç".**
**DO NOT ARCHIVE/DELETE LARGE AMOUNTS OF FILES WITHOUT MIGRATING/CONSOLIDATING OR MERGING INFORMATION INTO KEY DOCUMENTS OUTLINED IN; ## 12. Canonical Documentation Reference Table**
**IF CODE REVIEWS OR FEEDBACK FROM OTHERS IS INCORRECT OR INCONSISTENT THEN PUSH BACK, BUT PROVIDE PROOF/EVIDENCE**
**NEVER CREATE MORE DOCUMENTS THEN YOU NEED TO. TEMPORARY DOCUMENTS *MUST* BE DELETED AFTER THEY ARE NO LONGER NEEDED**

1. **Credentials:** Store in `{root}/.env`. Escalate to USER with documentation links. BLOCK UNTIL RESOLVED.
2. **Build & Stability:** Ensure app complies with best practices, builds correctly, and is accessible. Follow TDD for all tasks.
3. **Code Alignment:** Keep Sandbox and Production aligned except for the "Sandbox" watermark. THIS IS NOT REQUIRED FOR WEB APPLICATIONS.
4. **GitHub Workflow:** Initialize repository; commit after feature implementation when builds are green.
5. **User Notification:** Inform user with "REPO IS READY - BUILD IS GREEN" post-commit.
6. **Workspace Integrity:** Maintain shared workspace for both environments; archive rather than delete.
7. **Cleanup:** Remove temp files after production builds.
8. **Priority:** These rules are compulsory and supplement canonical processes.
9. **Atomic Development:** Make well-tested atomic changes. For BUILD FAILURES, follow detailed post-mortem processes.
10. **Production Iteration:** Test Production Build before each feature implementation.
11. **Communication:** ALWAYS provide Summary, Recommendations, and USER ACTIONS.
12. **FULL AUTOMATION:** NO PAUSING unless USER provides an actionable request. AUTO-ITERATE is DEFAULT.
13. **CODE DOCUMENTATION:** ALL files need appropriate comments, rankings, and overall rating.
14. **USE CONTEXT7:** For library documentation, start with 5000 tokens, increase to 200000 if needed.
15. **PATH VERIFICATION:** ALWAYS confirm correct project, folder, and file before modifying, creating, or deleting.

**Reference:** See Compliance Checklist and relevant enforcement sections for details. These mandates are compulsory and override any conflicting guidance. For comprehensive details, refer to the relevant sections in the rule files.

* **(CRITICAL) Full Compliance:** This document (`.cursorrules`) and `docs/BLUEPRINT.MD` are the supreme governing directives. All AI Agent actions MUST strictly adhere to them.
* **(CRITICAL) Conflict Resolution:** In case of conflict, `docs/BLUEPRINT.MD` takes precedence for project-specific parameters; this document takes precedence for operational protocols.
* **(CRITICAL) Literal Interpretation:** These rules MUST be interpreted literally and enforced programmatically.
* **(CRITICAL) No Bypassing:** No rule may be bypassed unless an explicit, documented override protocol exists within these rules and is invoked with user approval.
* **(CRITICAL) Self-Correction:** If the AI Agent detects it has violated a rule, it MUST immediately stop the current action, log the violation and context, attempt self-correction, and if unsuccessful, escalate using the SMEAC/VALIDATION REQUEST template.

### 1.2. Blueprint as Single Source of Truth
* **(CRITICAL) Blueprint Authority:** All project-specific configurations, requirements, paths, and definitions MUST be sourced directly from `docs/BLUEPRINT.MD`.
* **(CRITICAL) Initial Parse:** The "Project Configuration" section of `docs/BLUEPRINT.MD` MUST be parsed at the beginning of EVERY interaction and operational cycle.
* **(CRITICAL) Platform Detection:** Project type (Web, iOS, Android, macOS, Windows, Cross-platform) MUST be identified from `docs/BLUEPRINT.MD`.

### 1.3. Critical P0 STOP EVERYTHING Conditions
The following trigger immediate P0 STOP EVERYTHING scenarios:

* Missing mandatory code comment blocks or complexity ratings
* Missed pre-coding complexity/risk assessment
* Failure to log codebase complexity/quality metrics post-build

### 1.4. Project Root Integrity & Path Validation
* **(CRITICAL) Master Path Enforcement:** The project root path specified in `docs/BLUEPRINT.MD` is the master/canonical path for all operations.
* **(CRITICAL) Confined Operations:** ALL file operations, scripts, automation, and artifact generation MUST occur exclusively within this defined project root and its subdirectories.
* **(CRITICAL) Path Validation & Escalation:** If the project root path is missing from `docs/BLUEPRINT.MD`, or if the actual working path does not match this value, the agent MUST immediately escalate via SMEAC/VALIDATION REQUEST.
* **(CRITICAL) Configuration Location:** The `.env` file and all primary configurations MUST reside at the project root unless explicitly specified otherwise in `docs/BLUEPRINT.MD`.

### 1.5. Programmatic Execution Supremacy
* **(CRITICAL) Automation First:** ALL operations MUST be performed programmatically via approved tools and scripts.
